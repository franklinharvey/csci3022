    "As part of their Computer Science Jedi training, Tony and Dan are having a lightsaber duel. The rules of the lightsaber duel are as follows:\n",
    "* The duel is composed of a number of rounds.\n",
    "* Each round consists of Tony practicing his sweetest Jedi moves and trying to strike Dan, then Dan practicing *his* best moves and trying to strike Tony.\n",
    "* If Tony manages to strike Dan, then Tony is awarded a point, and similarly if Dan manages to strike Tony, then Dan is awarded a point.\n",
    "* If a round ends in a tie, then Tony and Dan proceed to another round. If a round ends with one Jedi scoring a point but the other one does not, then the Jedi who scored a point wins the duel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $T$ be the event that \"Tony wins the duel\", $E$ be the event that \"the duel ends after the first round of lightsaber strikes\", and $C$ be the event that \"the duel continues after the first round of lightsaber strikes\".  Suppose that the result of one lightsaber strike is independent of the other strikes, Tony successfully lands his lightsaber strikes with probability $p$, and Dan lands his strikes with probability $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A**: The duel will continue until Tony or Dan wins.  What is the sample space $\\Omega$ for this \"experiment\"?  Represent the outcomes of individual lightsaber strikes by $H$ for a hit and $M$ for a miss, and assume that Tony has the first strike in each round. At the very least, your answer should include all of the events in $\\Omega$ that include one or two rounds."

    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "A few ways to represent $\\Omega$ would be $\\Omega = E \\cup C$ and $\\Omega = T \\cup T^c$. If $\\Omega$ is just one round, or ($E$) we could say $\\Omega = H_T \\cap M_D \\cup M_D \\cap T_D$ where the subscript denotes who did the hits and misses. This is intuitive because a game can only be won if one person hits and the other misses, while Tony gets to go first. Since we know the game can last more than one round we can say $\\Omega = E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap ... \\cap E_{n-1} \\cap E_n$ where $E$'s subscipt denotes how many rounds are needed for a game to win, and every $E_k$ can be broken down to $E_k = H_T \\cap M_D \\cup M_D \\cap T_D$."

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50, \\$100 or \\$200, or pay the bank \\$50 or \\$100.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",

    "The probability seems to go up by a factor of 30 given that the player had gone to jail at least once. I insure this by subtracting every 30-round game that doesn't include at least one jail visit. These results feel correct, based on the probability of getting into jail (1 in 40) vs. the probability of getting out (1 in 36) and losing money for every round you stay in jail. "

But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
