    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Moodle by **11:55pm on Wednesday December 12**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on the practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",

Then the player is given two additional rolls, where they are allowed to re-roll any number of the dice, including potentially all of them or none of them. The goal is to obtain certain combinations of the dice values resulting after the third roll. Different combinations are worth different amounts of points, and the goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.\n",

Your lead scientist, aptly named Fin, has collected lots of relevant data at a local sharknado hotspot, the Boulder Reservoir[\\*](#footnote).

    "You learn that, actually, the coin $x$ is from a manufacturer that produces coins whose biases follow some statistical regularity. In particular, the bias of the $x$ coin is in the set $$p_x \\in \\{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, \\dots, 0.9\\}.$$ Furthermore, these biases all occur with equal probability. In other words, $\\tfrac{1}{9}$ of coins have bias $p_x=0.1$, $\\tfrac{1}{9}$ of coins have bias $p_x=0.2$, and so on. \n",

    "and using the LTP, I can rewrite the denominator as\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that there are multiple data points for each coin (3 for $x$ and 2 for $y$), but because the trials are conditionally independent, given the coin's bias, we can lump all of the data in together. Also note below that the binomial coefficients are multiplied together and present in each term, so they cancel out of the numerator and the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it looks like we just need to compute $Pr(\\text{data} \\mid p)$ for values of $p$ in the set listed in the problem statement.  All the values of $Pr(p)$ are simply $\\tfrac{1}{9}$ as stated. "

In particular, the bias of the $y$ coin is in the set $$p_y \\in \\{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, \\dots, 0.9\\}.$$ Furthermore, these biases all occur with different probability. In particular, the probability that a coin has bias $p_y$ is proportional to $p_y$, which could be written as \n",
    "$$Pr(p_y) \\propto p_y \\quad \\text{for} \\quad p_y \\in \\{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, \\dots, 0.9\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, write clearly the PMF for $p_y$, based on the information above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each possible value of $p_y$, compute the probability that Stella's $y$ coin has bias of $p_y$, given the data in her data file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plot your results with $p_y$ on the horizontal axis and $Pr(p_y \\mid \\text{data})$ on the vertical axis. Make the points or lines that you plot red. Plots without axis labels will receive zero credit."

    "The information that you have about the manufacturer of coin $x$ and coin $y$ is called _prior information_ since it can influence the estimates of a coin's bias at which you arrive, given the data from the coin's flipping. We often call the distribution $Pr(p_x)$ or $Pr(p_y)$ a _prior distribution_, and call $Pr(p_x \\mid \\text{data})$ or $Pr(p_y \\mid \\text{data})$ a _posterior distribution_, since it represents the estimate that you arrive at after you have taken the data into account. \n",
